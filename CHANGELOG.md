## [1.0.0] - 2025-08-02

### Added

- **Modern Web UI** - Complete graphical interface with real-time updates and responsive design
  - Interface accessible at `http://localhost:3000`
  - Real-time status updates via WebSocket connections
  - Live activity logs with auto-scrolling
  - Responsive design that works on desktop, tablet, and mobile
- **Interactive Operation Control** - Stop running operations from web UI
  - Dynamic button states that change from "Start" to "Stop" during operations
  - Graceful process termination with SIGTERM â†’ SIGKILL fallback
  - Real-time status tracking with `canStop` property
  - Visual feedback with color-coded buttons on web UI
- **CLI Integration for Web UI** - Web UI uses actual CLI commands for reliability
  - All operations execute real CLI commands (`npm run start`, `npm run load`, `npm run eject`)
  - Future-proof: web UI automatically benefits from CLI updates
  - Real program output streaming to web interface
- **Advanced CLI Flags** - New command line options for automation
  - `--no-confirm` flag to bypass "Rip or Dip?" prompt for automated ripping
  - `--quiet` flag to reduce verbose startup messages for cleaner output
  - Perfect for web UI context, automated scripts, docker or headless deployments, etc
- **MakeMKV version checking and validation** - The application now automatically checks MakeMKV version compatibility and provides user-friendly error messages when the installed version is too old MakeMKV to allow ripping. It also reports the installed version and warns about available updates.
- **Automatic MakeMKV path detection** - The application now automatically detects the MakeMKV installation path across Windows, macOS, and Linux, greatly simplifying setup for users.
- **Refactored configuration loading and validation** - Configuration loading and validation now handles missing or invalid custom MakeMKV paths gracefully, falling back to automatic detection when necessary (an install path for MakeMKV is no longer required).
- **Documentation updates** - Documentation has been updated to reflect changes to configuration, including troubleshooting steps related to MakeMKV installation.
- **Complete project refactor** with proper Node.js project structure
- **Modular architecture** with clear separation of concerns into services, utilities, and CLI modules
- **Docker support** - Full Docker containerization with multi-platform compatibility
  - Dockerfile with optimized Node.js Alpine base image
  - Docker Compose configuration for easy deployment
  - Automatic drive operation disabling in containerized environments
  - Health checks and proper volume management
- **NPM package publishing** - Ready for npm registry distribution
  - Binary executable support (`makemkv-auto-rip` command)
  - Proper package.json configuration for global installation
  - Development files excluded from published package
  - Optional dependencies for cross-platform compatibility
- **Cross-platform compatibility** - Windows-specific features gracefully disabled on other platforms
  - Docker environment detection
  - Comprehensive test coverage for Docker functionality and cross-platform behavior
  - Conditional import of Windows-only dependencies
  - Linux-compatible MakeMKV executable paths
- **Advanced drive management** - Separate configuration options for loading and ejecting drives
- **Flexible ripping modes** - Choose between async (parallel) or sync (sequential) ripping for optimal SSD or HDD performance
- **Enhanced logging** - Configurable 12hr/24hr time format options for console timestamps (defaults to 12hr)
- **Standalone drive commands** - `npm run load` and `npm run eject` for drive operations without ripping
- **Docker management commands** - `npm run docker:build`, `docker:run`, `docker:stop`, and `docker:logs`
- **Parallel disc processing** - Multiple discs now rip simultaneously instead of sequentially (originally completed by @ThreeHats and @Adam8234)
- **Enhanced error handling** - Comprehensive error handling throughout the application
- **Improved logging** - Structured logging with consistent formatting and colors
- **Configuration validation** - Automatic validation of required configuration settings
- **Configurable drive loading delay** - Users can now set custom delay times for drive loading operations, with the ability to disable delays entirely. The wait is disabled by default (only needed if you're ripping with certain USB or laptop/slimline drives that lack a retract mechanism).
- **Cross-platform drive operations** - New optical drive utility supports Windows, macOS, and Linux for loading and ejecting optical drives without external dependencies
- **Hybrid Windows drive implementation** - PowerShell WMI for accurate drive detection, native C++ addon using DeviceIoControl API for eject/load operations
- **Mount detection and waiting** - Configurable wait and re-polling mechanism to prevent drives from being skipped due to slow OS media detection.
- **Windows uses 64 bit** - Windows OS now uses the 64 bit version of makemkvcon (makemkvcon64.exe). Other OSes don't have seperate 32 vs 64 bit versions.
- **Configurable repeat mode** - Users can now enable/disable repeat mode through configuration, allowing the application to exit after ripping instead of prompting again

### Changed

- **Configuration format** - Migrated from JSON (`config/Default.json`) to YAML (`config.yaml`) for improved readability and easier editing
- **Configuration structure** - Reorganized into logical sections: `paths`, `drives`, `ripping`, etc for better organization
- **Path handling** - Cross-platform path normalization with support for forward slashes on all platforms (no more escaped backslashes!)
- **Configuration validation** - Enhanced validation with clearer error messages referencing `config.yaml`
- **Configuration drive options** - Split `ejectDVDs` into separate `loadDrives` and `ejectDrives` options for granular control
- **Ripping behavior options** - Added `rippingMode` option to choose between async/sync processing (defaults to async)
- **Logging system options** - Restructured to `logging` section with `timeFormat` option for 12hr/24hr console timestamps (defaults to 12hr)
- **Cross-platform executable paths** - MakeMKV executable path now adapts to Windows vs Linux vs MacOS environments
- **All dependencies updated** - All project dependencies have been updated to their latest versions
- **Removed `moment` and `colors`** - Replaced with `date-fns` for date/time and `chalk` for colored output
- **Project now supports the latest Node.js LTS version** - Minimum required Node.js version raised to latest LTS (older versions may work in theory, but are not officially supported)
- **Eliminated all batch files** - Replaced with simple npm commands
- **Project structure** - Code organized into logical modules under `src/` directory
- **Entry point** - Now uses `index.js` as main entry point instead of `AutoRip.js`
- **Import system** - Updated to ES6 modules throughout
- **Configuration management** - Centralized YAML configuration handling with validation and caching
- **User interface** - Improved CLI with better prompts and messaging

### Removed

- All `.bat` files (AutoRip.bat, DriveLoader.bat, Install-Node-Packages.bat)
- Monolithic `AutoRip.js` file (replaced with modular structure)
- **`win-eject` dependency** - Replaced with custom cross-platform optical drive utility

### Migration Notes

**Configuration Updates Required:**

- **Migrate from JSON to YAML:** Replace `config/Default.json` with `config.yaml`
- **New YAML format example:**

  ```yaml
  paths:
    makemkv_dir: "C:/Program Files (x86)/MakeMKV"
    movie_rips_dir: "./media"
    logging:
      enabled: true
      dir: "./logs"
      time_format: "12hr"

  drives:
    auto_load: true
    auto_eject: true

  ripping:
    rip_all_titles: false
    mode: "async"
  ```

- **Path format:** Use forward slashes (/) instead of escaped backslashes (\\) for all paths

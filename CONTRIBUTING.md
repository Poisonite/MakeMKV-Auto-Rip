# Contributing to MakeMKV Auto Rip

Thank you for your interest in contributing to MakeMKV Auto Rip! This document provides guidelines and information for contributors.

## ü§ù Welcome Contributors

We welcome contributions of all kinds:

- üêõ Bug reports and fixes
- ‚ú® New features and enhancements
- üìö Documentation improvements
- üß™ Tests and quality improvements
- üåç Platform compatibility (Linux, macOS)
- üé® User interface improvements

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

#### General Development

- **Node.js** >= 22.0.0
- **Git** for version control
- **MakeMKV** installed for testing

#### Platform-Specific Requirements

**For Windows Optical Drive Development:**

- **Visual Studio 2022+** with "Desktop development with C++" workload (VS 2022 build tools with that workload will work as well)
- **Python 3.12+** (for node-gyp compilation)
- **Windows 10+** (for testing drive operations)
- **Administrator privileges** (for testing drive control)

**For Other Features:**

- **Any Platform** - Windows, macOS, or Linux
- **No build tools required** - Uses pre-built native components (only used for Windows anyways)

### Development Setup

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/MakeMKV-Auto-Rip.git
   cd MakeMKV-Auto-Rip
   ```
3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. **Create a feature branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

### Building Native Components (Windows Development Only)

If you're developing Windows optical drive interaction functionality, you may need to rebuild the native addon:

```bash
# Build the native addon (requires Visual Studio + Python)
npm run build

# Build debug version for development
npm run build:debug

# Clean build artifacts
npm run clean
```

**Note:** Most contributors won't need to build native components since:

- Pre-built binaries are included in the repository
- Only Windows optical drive changes require rebuilding
- Other features work on all platforms without compilation

## üìã Development Guidelines

### Code Style

We follow these conventions:

- **ES6+ JavaScript** with modules (`import`/`export`)
- **Async/await** for asynchronous operations
- **PascalCase** for classes (`DiscService`)
- **camelCase** for functions and variables (`getAvailableDiscs`)
- **kebab-case** for file names (`disc.service.js`)
- **UPPER_SNAKE_CASE** for constants (`MEDIA_TYPES`)

### Project Structure

```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cli/          # User interface and command handling
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ services/     # Business logic and external integrations
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/        # Reusable utility functions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config/       # Configuration management
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ constants/    # Application constants
```

### Adding New Features

1. **Services** - Add business logic to appropriate service modules
2. **Utilities** - Create reusable functions in utils/
3. **CLI** - Update interface for user-facing changes
4. **Config** - Add new configuration options if needed
5. **Documentation** - Update README and relevant docs

## üêõ Bug Reports

### Before Submitting

- Check existing issues to avoid duplicates
- Test with the latest version
- Verify the issue isn't configuration-related

When you create a bug report, GitHub will guide you through our bug report template to ensure we get all the information needed to help you.
P.S. Thank you so much for helping to improve MakeMKV Auto Rip in any capacity! Your feedback is truly appreciated!

## üí° Feature Requests

We welcome feature requests! When you create a feature request issue, GitHub will guide you through our template to help us understand your needs and use case.
P.S. Thank you so much for contributing to MakeMKV Auto Rip! Your assistance benefits everyone!

## üîß Development Workflow

### Making Changes

1. **Write clean, documented code**
2. **Follow existing patterns** in the codebase
3. **Add JSDoc comments** for public methods
4. **Test your changes** thoroughly
5. **Update documentation** as needed

### Commit Guidelines

Use clear, descriptive commit messages:

```bash
# Good
git commit -m "Add parallel processing for multiple disc ripping"
git commit -m "Fix drive ejection issue on USB drives"
git commit -m "Update README with new configuration options"

# Less good
git commit -m "Fix bug"
git commit -m "Update stuff"
```

### Pull Request Process

1. **Ensure your branch is up to date:**

   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git rebase upstream/master
   ```

2. **Test your changes:**

   ```bash
   npm start  # Test main functionality
   npm run load  # Test drive loading
   npm run eject  # Test drive ejection
   ```

3. **Create a pull request** with:
   - Clear title and description
   - Reference to related issues
   - Description of changes made
   - Testing performed

When you create a pull request, GitHub will automatically populate it with our pull request template to ensure all necessary information is included.

## üß™ Testing

### Manual Testing

- **Test with different disc types (if possible)** (DVD, Blu-ray)
- **Test with multiple drives** when possible
- **Test error scenarios** (missing discs, invalid config)
- **Test all npm commands** (`start`, `load`, `eject`)

### Future: Automated Testing

We're planning to add:

- Unit tests for utility functions
- Integration tests for services
- End-to-end testing workflows

## üåç Cross-Platform Support

Currently Windows-only, but we welcome contributions for:

- **Linux support** - Adapt drive operations and paths (we're considering [`eject-media`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eject-media) as one option)
- **macOS support** - Similar adaptations
- **Docker containers** - For consistent environments

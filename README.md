## üìã Requirements

### Essential Software

1. **[MakeMKV](https://www.makemkv.com/)** - Required for all ripping operations (Each new version of Auto Rip is only tested with the most recent MakeMKV version)
2. **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)** - Runtime environment (only >= v22 officially tested)
3. **Cross-platform OS support** - Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux (only (officially) tested on Windows 10+ & Debian/Ubuntu Linux)

### Cross-Platform Support

- **Automatic MakeMKV Detection** - Finds MakeMKV installation automatically on all platforms:
  - **Windows**: `C:/Program Files/MakeMKV` or `C:/Program Files (x86)/MakeMKV`
  - **Linux**: `/usr/bin`, `/usr/local/bin`, or `/opt/makemkv/bin`
  - **macOS**: `/Applications/MakeMKV.app/Contents/MacOS`, `/opt/homebrew/bin`, or `/usr/local/bin`
- **Manual Override** - Configure custom MakeMKV path in `config.yaml` if needed
- **Optical Drive Management** - Drive load/eject operations work on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **Windows implementation** - Uses native C++ addon for reliable Windows DeviceIoControl API access
- **Pre-built native components** - No compilation required, native addon included in repository
- **Administrator privileges required on Windows** - Run terminal as administrator for drive operations
- **No Python or build tools required** - Ready to use out of the box

### Recommended Software

- **Java** - Required for certain MakeMKV features
- **VLC Media Player** - For viewing ripped .mkv files

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. **Download this repository**
2. **Install Node.js** from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. **Configure the application** (see Configuration section below)
5. **Configure MakeMKV GUI** (see MakeMKV Configuration section below)

### Linux Drive Management Setup (Optional)

**Note: Only required for Linux users who want to use automatic drive ejecting**

If you encounter errors related to ejecting drives or receive sudo/admin prompts when inserting/ejecting discs, follow these steps:

1. **Add your user to the cdrom group:**

   ```bash
   sudo usermod -aG cdrom $USER
   ```

2. **Create a polkit rule for passwordless optical drive operations:**

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/polkit-1/rules.d/70-udisks2-no-password.rules
   ```

3. **Add the following content to the file:**

   ```javascript
   polkit.addRule(function (action, subject) {
     if (
       subject.isInGroup("cdrom") &&
       action.id.startsWith("org.freedesktop.udisks2.")
     ) {
       return polkit.Result.YES;
     }
   });
   ```

4. **Reboot your system:**
   ```bash
   sudo reboot
   ```
   This configuration allows users in the cdrom group to perform optical drive operations without requiring sudo passwords.

```

#### Configuration Options

- **`paths.makemkv_dir`** - MakeMKV installation directory (OPTIONAL - auto-detected if not specified)
  - Supports forward slashes on all platforms
  - For Advanced Users: Only needed if MakeMKV is installed in a non-standard location
- **`paths.movie_rips_dir`** - Root directory for ripped movies (create a dedicated folder)
- **`paths.logging.enabled`** - Enable/disable writing MakeMKV output to log files (`true` or `false`)
- **`paths.logging.dir`** - Directory for log files
- **`paths.logging.time_format`** - Time format for console/terminal timestamps (`"12hr"` or `"24hr"`)
- **`drives.auto_load`** - Auto-load/close drives before ripping (`true` or `false`)
- **`drives.auto_eject`** - Auto-eject drives after ripping completion (`true` or `false`)
- **`drives.load_delay`** - Delay time (in seconds) when loading drives, allows time for manual drive closing (`0` to disable, default: `0`)
- **`ripping.rip_all_titles`** - Rip all titles that are above MakeMKV min length (`true`) or longest title only (`false`)
- **`ripping.mode`** - Ripping mode (`"async"` for parallel processing or `"sync"` for sequential processing)
- **`mount_detection.wait_timeout`** - Maximum time (in seconds) to wait for drives to mount media before starting rip (`0` to disable, default: `10`)
- **`mount_detection.poll_interval`** - Polling interval (in seconds) to check for newly mounted drives (default: `1`)
- **`interface.repeat_mode`** - Enable repeat mode to prompt again after ripping (`true` or `false`, default: `true`)

**Important Notes:**

- Recommended: Create dedicated folders for movie rips and logs
- **Performance tip**: Use `"sync"` ripping mode for HDD destinations where concurrent writes impact performance... for SSDs, `"async"` will yield much better overall performance
- **Mount detection**: The mount detection feature prevents drives from being skipped due to slow OS media detection, especially beneficial on older hardware. Set `wait_timeout: 0` to disable this feature.

### MakeMKV GUI Configuration

Before using MakeMKV Auto Rip, configure the MakeMKV GUI:

1. **View ‚Üí Preferences ‚Üí Video**

   - Set "Minimum title length (seconds)" to a value below 1000
     - Other settings work, but this will yield the best results (i.e. not skipping real titles, but improving speed by skipping empty or useless clips)

2. **View ‚Üí Preferences ‚Üí IO**

   - Set "Read retry count" to 10 (helps with damaged/scratched discs)

3. **View ‚Üí Preferences ‚Üí Language**

   - Set interface and preferred languages for subtitles/audio
   - Select "auto" and "none" to include all audio and subtitle tracks

4. **For Blu-ray discs:**
   - Run at least one Blu-ray through the MakeMKV GUI first
   - Enter a valid key (beta key works - but please support the MakeMKV team if you find their software useful or time-saving!) before using Auto Rip

## üéØ Usage

### Main Application (Ripping)

```bash
npm start          # Interactive ripping interface
```

### Drive Management Only

```bash
npm run load       # Load/close all drives
npm run eject      # Eject all drives
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Failed to start application" error**

   - Check that all paths in `config.yaml` exist and use forward slashes (/) for cross-platform compatibility
   - Ensure MakeMKV is properly installed

2. **"(Windows) Native optical drive addon failed to load" error**

   - This indicates a corrupted installation or missing native components
   - Try reinstalling the application: `npm install` - or building native addon from scratch `npm run build`
   - Ensure you're running on a supported Windows version (Windows 10+ officially tested - theoretically compatible back to ~Windows 2000)

3. **Drive eject/load operations fail**

   - **Windows: Run as administrator** - Right-click terminal and "Run as administrator"
     - Windows drive operations require elevated privileges for DeviceIoControl API access
   - macOS/Linux: Standard user privileges should work for most drives (See Linux troubleshooting section above)
   - Manual drive operation may be needed if software control isn't supported by hardware (or hardware lacks the proper physical mechanism)

4. **No discs detected**

   - Make sure discs are inserted and readable
   - Try running MakeMKV GUI to test disc compatibility

5. **Drive loading issues**

   - Some USB and laptop drives may not support automatic loading
   - Manually close drives that don't auto-close within the 5-second waiting period

6. **Ripping failures**
   - Check disc condition (scratches, damage)
   - Try ripping manually with MakeMKV GUI
   - Increase retry count in MakeMKV settings

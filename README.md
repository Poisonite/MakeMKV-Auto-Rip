- **Windows implementation** - Uses native C++ addon for reliable Windows DeviceIoControl API access
- **Pre-built native components** - No compilation required, native addon included in repository
- **Administrator privileges required on Windows** - Run terminal as administrator for drive operations
- **No Python or build tools required** - Ready to use out of the box

### Recommended Software

- **Java** - Required for certain MakeMKV features
- **VLC Media Player** - For viewing ripped .mkv files

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. **Download this repository**
2. **Install Node.js** from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. **Configure the application** (see Configuration section below)
5. **Configure MakeMKV GUI** (see MakeMKV Configuration section below)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Application Configuration (`config/default.json`)

```json
{
  "Path": {
    "mkvDir": {
      "Dir": "C:\\Program Files (x86)\\MakeMKV"
    },
    "movieRips": {
      "Dir": "C:\\Your\\Movie\\Rips"
    },
    "logging": {
      "toFiles": "true",
      "Dir": "C:\\Your\\Log\\Directory",
      "timeFormat": "12hr"
    },
    "loadDrives": {
      "Enabled": "true"
    },
    "ejectDrives": {
      "Enabled": "true"
    },
    "ripAll": {
      "Enabled": "false"
    },
    "rippingMode": {
      "Mode": "async"
    }
  }
}
```

#### Configuration Options

- **`mkvDir`** - MakeMKV installation directory (usually default location)
- **`movieRips`** - Root directory for ripped movies (create a dedicated folder)
- **`logging.toFiles`** - Enable/disable writing MakeMKV output to log files (`"true"` or `"false"`)
- **`logging.Dir`** - Directory for log files
- **`logging.timeFormat`** - Time format for console/terminal timestamps (`"12hr"` or `"24hr"`)
- **`loadDrives.Enabled`** - Auto-load/close drives before ripping (`"true"` or `"false"`)
- **`ejectDrives.Enabled`** - Auto-eject drives after ripping completion (`"true"` or `"false"`)
- **`ripAll.Enabled`** - Rip all titles that are above MakeMKV min length (`"true"`) or longest title only (`"false"`)
- **`rippingMode.Mode`** - Ripping mode (`"async"` for parallel processing or `"sync"` for sequential processing

**Important Notes:**

- Use double backslashes (`\\`) in Windows paths
- Create directories manually - the application cannot create missing folders
- Recommended: Create dedicated folders for movie rips and logs
- **Performance tip**: Use `"sync"` ripping mode for HDD destinations where concurrent writes impact performance... for SSDs, `"async"` will yield much better overall performance

### MakeMKV GUI Configuration

Before using MakeMKV Auto Rip, configure the MakeMKV GUI:

1. **View ‚Üí Preferences ‚Üí Video**

   - Set "Minimum title length (seconds)" to a value below 1000
     - Other settings work, but this will yield the best results (i.e. not skipping real titles, but improving speed by skipping empty or useless clips)

2. **View ‚Üí Preferences ‚Üí IO**

   - Set "Read retry count" to 10 (helps with damaged/scratched discs)

3. **View ‚Üí Preferences ‚Üí Language**

   - Set interface and preferred languages for subtitles/audio
   - Select "auto" and "none" to include all audio and subtitle tracks

4. **For Blu-ray discs:**
   - Run at least one Blu-ray through the MakeMKV GUI first
   - Enter a valid key (beta key works) before using Auto Rip

## üéØ Usage

### Main Application (Ripping)

```bash
npm start          # Interactive ripping interface
# or
npm run rip        # Same as above
# or
node index.js      # Direct execution
```

### Drive Management Only

```bash
npm run load       # Load/close all drives
npm run eject      # Eject all drives
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Failed to start application" error**

   - Check that all paths in `config/default.json` exist
   - Ensure MakeMKV is properly installed

2. **"Native optical drive addon failed to load" error**

   - This indicates a corrupted installation or missing native components
   - Try reinstalling the application: `npm install`
   - Ensure you're running on a supported Windows version (Windows 10+)

3. **Drive eject/load operations fail**

   - **Windows: Run as administrator** - Right-click terminal and "Run as administrator"
   - Windows drive operations require elevated privileges for DeviceIoControl API access
   - macOS/Linux: Standard user privileges should work for most drives
   - Manual drive operation may be needed if software control isn't supported by hardware

4. **No discs detected**

   - Make sure discs are inserted and readable
   - Try running MakeMKV GUI first to test disc compatibility

5. **Drive loading issues**

   - Some USB and laptop drives may not support automatic loading
   - Manually close drives that don't auto-close within the 5-second waiting period

6. **Ripping failures**
   - Check disc condition (scratches, damage)
   - Try ripping manually with MakeMKV GUI first
   - Increase retry count in MakeMKV settings
